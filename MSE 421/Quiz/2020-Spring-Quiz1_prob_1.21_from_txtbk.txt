Textbook problem 1.21 (diagram is in textbook)

A machine part is modeled as a pendulum connected to a spring as illustrated in
Figure P1.21. Ignore the mass of the pendulumâ€™s rod and derive the equation of mo-
tion. Then following the procedure used in Example 1.1.1, linearize the equation of
motion and compute the formula for the natural frequency. Assume that the rotation
is small enough so that the spring only deflects horizontally.
